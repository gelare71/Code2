The followings are necessary explanations:

The file "proposedschem.pv" is the Proverif implementation of the proposed protocol under general assumptions, the file "proposedscheme(long_term_secret_exposed).pv" is the Proverif implementation of the proposed protocol in the case that adversary knows the long term secret, the file "proposedscheme(ephemeral_secrets_exposed).pv" is the Proverif implementation of the proposed protocol in the case that adversary knows the ephemeral secrets and the file "proposedschem.spthy" is the Tamarin implementation of the proposed protocol.
